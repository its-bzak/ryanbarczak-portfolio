                <div class="project_description">Inspired by a homework assignment from my Computer Science II class, the Media Store Simulator is
                    a full-stack web application where users can rent or buy select media items (records, movies, books, etc.) and the inventory
                    updates accordingly. Users are able to filter by a select media type, see their purchase / rental history, view current store
                    inventory, and more. Admins (or store manager accounts) are given the capability to add new items to the inventory, see purchase
                    histories, etc. This was the first real project that I had worked out outside of the classroom, which is pretty evident
                    by looking at the repository. Speaking of which, as this was early into my experience with GitHub, I had some difficulties
                    whenever I tried initializing and avoiding nested repositories. This issue is what lead to the lack of content within the frontend
                    directory.
